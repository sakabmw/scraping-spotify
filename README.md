A repo for exercise to scrape my own Spotify data.
The main script, `recent-play.py`, will retrieve an aggregated data of the user's Spotify recent play
from the latest 50 songs played by the time the data will be retrieved.
The data will show the artist names and the number of albums and tracks, as well as the latest and the earliest play time of each artist's tracks.
